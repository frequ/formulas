    <h2>Surface Area Formulas</h2>

    <h3 class="c1"><b>Surface Area of a Cube = 6 a</b><sup><b>2</b></sup></h3>

    <p class="c2"><img src="cube.gif" align="baseline" /> (a is the length of the side of
    each edge of the cube)</p>

    <p class="c2">In words, the surface area of a cube is the area of the six squares
    that cover it. The area of one of them is a*a, or a <sup>2</sup> . Since these are
    all the same, you can multiply one of them by six, so the surface area of a cube is 6
    times one of the sides squared.</p>

    <h3 class="c3">Surface Area of a Rectangular Prism = 2ab + 2bc + 2ac</h3>

    <p><img src="rprism.gif" align="baseline" /> (a, b, and c are the lengths of the 3
    sides)</p>

    <p>In words, the surface area of a rectangular prism is the area of the six
    rectangles that cover it. But we don't have to figure out all six because we know
    that the top and bottom are the same, the front and back are the same, and the left
    and right sides are the same.</p>

    <p>The area of the top and bottom (side lengths a and c) = a*c. Since there are two
    of them, you get 2ac. The front and back have side lengths of b and c. The area of
    one of them is b*c, and there are two of them, so the surface area of those two is
    2bc. The left and right side have side lengths of a and b, so the surface area of one
    of them is a*b. Again, there are two of them, so their combined surface area is
    2ab.</p>

    <h3>&nbsp;<b>Surface Area of Any Prism</b></h3>

    <p class="c2"><img src="prism.gif" align="baseline" /> &nbsp;(b is the shape of the
    ends)</p>

    <p class="c2">Surface Area = Lateral area + Area of two ends</p>

    <p class="c2">(Lateral area) = (perimeter of shape <b>b</b>) * L</p>

    <p class="c2">Surface Area = (perimeter of shape <b>b</b>) * L+ 2*(Area of shape
    <b>b</b>)</p>

    <h3 class="c2"><b>Surface Area of a Sphere = 4 <i>pi</i> r<sup>2</sup></b>
    </h3>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"><img src="circle.gif" align="bottom" /> (r is radius
    of circle)</span></p>

    <h3 class="c2"><span class="c4"><br />
    <b>Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2 <i>pi</i> r<sup>2</sup> + 2 <i>pi</i> r h</b>
    </span></h3>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"><span class="c4"><img src="cylinder1.gif" width="75"
    height="50" /> (h is the height of the cylinder, r is the radius of the
    top)</span></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"><span class="c4">Surface Area = Areas of top and
    bottom +Area of the side</span></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"><span class="c4">Surface Area = 2(Area of top) +
    (perimeter of top)* height</span></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"><span class="c4">Surface Area = 2(<i>pi</i> r<sup>2</sup>) + (2 <i>pi</i> r)* h</span></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"><span class="c4">In words, the easiest way is to think
    of a can. The surface area is the areas of all the parts needed to cover the can.
    That's the top, the bottom, and the paper label that wraps around the
    middle.</span></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"><span class="c4">You can find the area of the top (or
    the bottom). That's the formula for area of a circle (<i>pi</i>&nbsp;r<sup>2</sup>).
    Since there is both a top and a bottom, that gets multiplied by
    two.</span></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"><span class="c4">The side is like the label of the
    can. If you peel it off and lay it flat it will be a rectangle. The area of a
    rectangle is the product of the two sides. One side is the height of the can, the
    other side is the perimeter of the circle, since the label wraps once around the can.
    So the area of the rectangle is (2 <i>pi</i> r)* h.</span></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"><span class="c4">Add those two parts together and you
    have the formula for the surface area of a cylinder.</span></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"><span class="c4">Surface Area = 2(<i>pi</i> r
    <sup>2</sup>) + (2 <i>pi</i> r)* h</span></span></p>

    <h3 class="c2"><span class="c4"><span class="c4"><b>Units</b></span></span></h3>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">These equations will give you correct answers if you
    keep the units straight. For example - to find the surface area of a cube with sides
    of 5 inches, the equation is:</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Surface Area = 6*(5 inches)<sup>2</sup> = 6*(25 square
    inches) = 150 sq. inches</span></p>
